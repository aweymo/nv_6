Love of Fighting Is the Curse of Japanese  Says Dr. Albert 8. Ashmead. Mikado Only a Figurehead Who Tokyo God Ia the Popular Mind  While the “Sat-cho ’” or War Party  Dr. Albert 8. Ashmead of New York and late foreign medical director of the Tokyo hospital in Japan  wrote as follows under a recent date to the editor of the New York Herald: ‘In your article in the Herald  entitled ‘Japan Prepares For War With the United States ’ in your quotation of and remarks from the Head de Paris concerning Mr. Nakahashi Tokugoro’s allusions in the Revue des Deux Mondes of Japan to the ‘Empire of the Mikado’ you have overlooked a very important point  which is always considered by the Japanese mind In Its ratiocinations. “The empire of the mikado to a Japanese means spiritual empire and not \u0026 mere material or temporal empire. For many centuries  while the mikados (heavenly gates) were isolated in their holy seclusion behind the Devil’s gate at Kyoto  there reigned mere temporal rulers  the shoguns (great generals) at Tokyo. In 1867  the beginning of the Meiji era  the Sat-cho (Satsuma and Choshin provincials of high degree)  a political ring  overthrew the shoguns and brought the figurehead of the empire from his sacred isolation at Kyoto. “He is the religious head of the nation  typifying the Bushido (war spirit) of the people  that is all. He Is not emperor—a word the Japanese do not know  although they use it to deceive westerners. A mikado is Tenno (son of heaven or God). He never dies  but hodzurus (translates). He is God in man’s form and as such can only reign in the spirit of the ration. ‘The real temporal ruler of the empire of Japan is that Sat-cho  a political clique  and the mikado {s only puppet king. His mentality is of a very low order. In fact  all the high nobles of Japan under the old order of nobility were rather effeminate of not really imbecile. The mikado is no exception to this category. Therefore he is easily handled politically by the ringmasters  whose only aim is to satisfy Samourisu  or Bushido  the war spirit of the nation  handed down to them from the time of Krishna  god of war  of Brahmanism  even at the beginning of protestant Buddhism. “This Is the curse of the Japanese people—that love of fighting—and be sides  there Is the worship of heroes. And how are heroes to be made in a Japanese point of view save by war? Samurais before the disestablishment of feudalism In 1867 was satiated by wars between the Damion. Each province or high class family’s servants (samurai) would fight with the next ones. But in 1867 samurai were nationalized into a central army  or fighting force. “This spirit of war  the true soul of Japan  will never be willing to remain in barracks for any length of time. It soon demands a new war. Where will a war be found to appease it by that ring of political tricksters called Satcho except In a foreign war? Thus ft will be ever. “After they have fought America they must find some other country to make war upon  That next In all probability will be Holland  for Japan must have the Dutch West Indies. And so it will go on. “Rut what [I write this letter for especially is to point out that the ‘spiritual empire’ of that pagan ‘ruler’ Is what we have most to dread. It Is that which threatens us already In our Pacific states. Paganism of the mika. do is already getting a foothold upon our Christian European and American shores. This is what we must guard against most. 4The war that is on in the world to day is that between two civilizations— paganism and Christianity. Until Jap Japanese have been taught by defeat that their emperor  as we call him  Is not a god or holy avatar there will be end: less wars on the part of Japan. We must put down her unholy paganism and then there will be peace of Chris Christianity. Which will win  paganism o!

No  not too many work in the orchard.Not too many in  the orchard. There was an apple orchard- Not too many orchards in Walla Walla.

The railroad was ﬁnished  the  Chinese was just kind of converging one into the other a little  bit. And so  therefore-- right after the railroad I. think the  government won\u0027t let the Chinese come in anyway-the women  come in anyway. In the ﬁrst place the Chinese Government  didn\u0027t want their wives to go. Then after that when the Chinese  Government don\u0027t mind so much- when the Boxer\u0027’s uprising  and then they open up the west to China  then the American  Government don\u0027t want the Chinese people to move in here.  So the gates was kinda closed in one end or the other. So the  boys-- we had to come in-- most of the time-- a lot of Chinese  come in as a general rule had to fake a name or something in  order to say they are citizens or something like that. That\u0027s  why a lot of Chinese people are that way  through that   because they only allow a hundred and eighteen a year. A  year  they only allow that much.

Then my father went back  I  think 1800 something. Then went back to China. Must be  ten  ﬁfteen years  I think. Then he decided When he was  to come back. That\u0027s all. in China during that time  then he got married. Yeah  he got married. I imagine when he come over  did he come over with his  father  too: No. He just come over as a young man. A  laborer. He didn\u0027t do mining? He worked on the railroad. No  the railroad. The mining was afterwards. The people  of China -the Chinese people are not very good miners   because they never had mining in China  that way  see.  And so  they came over as a railroad workers as  Laborers. They even tell them  dig ditches and stuff  that’s  ﬁne. But as miners  we have no experience. But after the  railroad ‘built  then they have to do something. Then they  got the idea to go out  you know they go pan gold. At that time they don\u0027t have any more jobs with the  railroad  so they had to do something else. Do something to create a job for themself to get  to eat. have to do something else.

I think he worked longer than that in fact. The ﬁrst  time  he worked longer than that  he came over because   my mother is quite a bit younger than my father  so I  imagine he was over I didn\u0027t talk to him so much at that  time  I was young.

It received considerable publicity at the time as an “anti-Asiatic” movement  but the Japanese were not specifically mentioned.

But: the Trish immigration prior to the great famine. was not large. Between 1820 and 1830 it amounted to only h0 724  and in the following decade to 307 381. So that if we make every allowance for those whose grandparents or  remoter ancestors were of Irish origin  and who therefore do not appear in. tho census as Irish  we need hardly add :at the outside  more than 41 000 000 to the total already given  which would thus be raised to 6 000 000. But from these must be deducted the Irish Protestants who  in tho present century at least  cannot be reckoned with the others politically  and they hardly number less: than 600.000. Thus the total Catholic Irish element in the states cannot exceed 6 600 000. In further confirmation of this estimate may be quoted a statement  made not very long since {In an Irish-American newspaper  that the total Catholic population In the states is about 10 000 000. Gut   10 000 000 are largely made up of immigrants from the Catholic counties of Europe and from French Canada and Mexico—the ‘mutual figures are given In the census—and these  in addition to a proportion of the Germans  which an hardly: be less than 2 600 000  must number some 4 000 000; thus leaving the Irish which does not differ greatly from the estimate already arrived a t. It may be added that the English immigration into the States has be on greatly on the Increase since 1870  and the explanation as to the exaggerated numbers of the Trish is due to their being principally massed in the great elites of the Northeast and tho neighboring middle states.","community":"Irish","lat":"45.52345","long":"-122.67621"},"color":"rgb(0,173,117)","size":15.0},{"label":"\"Seattle Unions Again Protest Filipino Labor\"","x":8.750150680541992,"y":25.871353149414062,"id":"39","attributes":{"date":"1929-03-29","object location":"https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/item.html?id\u003dmaplanguage039","creator":"The Seattle Daily Times","Modularity Class":"2","description":"Account of calls for exclusion against Filipino labor by the president of the Washington State Federation of Labor on account of \"spinal meningitis menace.\"","industry":"Fishing","location":"Seattle; Washington","text":"SEATTLE. unionists: . today - called) attention to a number of resolutions unanimously adopted in recent months by various state and local la-}\u0027 bor. organizations . demanding exclusion of Filipino laborer immigrants] from the United States.

IJInaccuracies were numbers and egregious in Oregon and Washington  and were demonstrated so to be by supplementary enumerations. Such supplementary work was done elsewhere  and the truth may be that the amendments made brought the census out nearly correct. The showing of the proportion of those Who had been here before  among {immigrants  however  is significant. By a recent investigation  extending over the records back to July  1893  it was found that out of 2484 Bohemian immigrants 150 had been in this country before. Out of 38 711 German immigrants  30536 had been jin this country before. Out of 9992 English  19 686 Irish and 2342 scotch immigrants  7440 had been residents of this country in previous years  and out of 42.074 Italian immigrants  S111 were returning to the United States. Meanwhile the falling off In the aggregate Of immigration  noticed since 1892  continues unabated. For the final year ending June 380  1892. the total number of Immigrants arriving in this country from all sources was 666 663. In the next fiscal year  ending June fl)  1893  the number fell to 428 652  and in the next twelve months  ending June 30  1894  275 764 immigrants  . rived. In the nine fiscal months which have passed since  140 080 have reached this: Country  and if the same portion is maintained during the remaining three months of the fiscal year. even With the usual increase in April  May and J June  less than 200.000 immigrants will have arrived In this country during the twelve months ending J June \"0. 1895. It is noteworthy that the financial Cine pressure does not serve to account at least for this decrease  especially when it is considered that the hard times have been general the   as well as Chis country  and when a comparison is made with the falling off occasioned by previous panics. Thus the immigration for the financial year ending J June 30. 18:4  fell off only 26 per cent below that for the previous twelve months  and for the next succeeding twelve month only 38 per cent; while the immigration. for each fiscal year since 1892 has Shown a steady fall of 80 per percent at least  and sometimes more.

C: Yes  there are still people  the oldest of people that I know that live  around  oh  there was a little store  around the K. St. area  and in fact  thats where we settled. My father had a house on K. St when he  came here  right on 13th  and K. St. In those days it was beautiful.  We could walk back and forth on K. St. it was all illuminated and we  didn\u0027t have to worry about any mugging or anything. We could walk  at night  there  in fact we did all our shopping on K. St. I didn’t know  how to talk  I used to go to Pete Verone\u0027s on 13th  right there by  where we were living and just talk to him in Italian and a little farther  from there was Milone  who later became a policeman in this town.  And on 17th there was Natale Reda who bad another grocery store  there. He was a very very good man and had a big family there that I  remember so plainly. He used to come and deliver the groceries and  never forgot to bring a bag of candy for the children in those days   most of the people in that little community...END OF TRACK ONE TRACK TWO  TAPE ONE.

I bet if they went to Italy they couldn\u0027t talk Italian either.  They would feel just as stupid. W: I know that in that area of town  there were also a lot of the  Scandinavians and mostly Scandinavians in that area . did your  community ever have any problems  with the Scandinavians in town? C: Well I never heard really because the Italian people as a rule  are  very friendly people. And even if the Scandinavians felt superior or  what I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think they had a chance to be antagonistic  or unfriendly with the people  they were very friendly. But I know  only once that my ﬁrst husband who had to quit the job that he had  for seventeen years  he had to work under Scandinavians who  knew more about the carpentry than my husband ever dreamed of.  But he was trying his best  and he had to quit. He couldn\u0027t work with  them. He knew that he wasn\u0027t wanted there because he was an  Italian and they were Scandinavian people. But outside of that I  don\u0027t know of any other really antagonism. We got along ﬁne  in  fact  I had more Scandinavian friends around here since I\u0027ve been  here. And never had any problems with anyone. W: What kind of work as there available for the Italian community?  C: For most of them it was ditch digging. They couldn\u0027t speak but  they could work and they were willing to work. Naturally as they got  to know the language a little bit they were able to go here and there  and look for a better job.

So this history is a way back  we don\u0027t  know time ﬂies by according to  we don\u0027t know how long the days  or the months were all about but I know that history\u0027s back there. Where the Indian comes from  we don\u0027t know but that is the  background of where I happen to be a Swinomish. W: What did your family do  to make your living when you were on  the S: Well  they  when I came  ﬁshing was the main thing. Fishing. reservation? The ﬁrst time  I remember we went to Lopez Island and there was  two families  Bob Edwards and Billy Edwards  there were seniors   they had two half brothers Charlie and Dick Edwards. They were  from Swinomish  Dick Edwards and then  their mother was from  the Swinomish  their father Amish  come from Dumish Island The  cannery was started over here  west of Anacortes and so they had  these people here  they gave them  they had reef nets long before  the coming of the white man so  these two brothers  four brothers  got together and they went up to Lopez island: and their ﬁsh nets  and they were so primitive. I guess at that time I was around four  or ﬁve  anyhow  as I remember it. I laugh about it once in awhile.  They gave them ropes and nets  anchors  so they could anchor  these reef nets  these people so primitive  they said that Sock Eye  would not follow the net  they\u0027d have to make ropes twisted cedar  to make ropes . They (Laughs) They didn\u0027t wouldn\u0027t use anchors   they would use big boulders. catch a lot of ﬁsh  thats the ﬁrst time I went ﬁshing  and to go on  with that story  I remember that  there was a big ﬁeld day  it used to  be in Olympia for quite a while  the ranchers around here were  settling  oh there was Apple Creek and so on and anyhow they had  a ball ﬁeld where they had been ﬁshing  ﬁrst catch from this here reef net  they roasted them then they was a  procession clear around this ball ﬁeld  and they were singing the  tunes of this sock eye  because this sock eye  was a relative of  theirs going back into the sea where the  one of the Samish girls  had married into the people from the Sea. The land of the Sock  Eye Salmond so they were giving thanks to the spirit who  brought the salmon  they went clear around and they came  back  then they spread everything on the head tables and  spread it on the ground there  everybody ate. When they got  through eating and there was a big baseball game  but the thing  is that they still believe in they had to have the ways that the  spirit guide  they had a spirit guide that helped them with their  ﬁshing. But then they continued  after the ﬁshing was or the  Cannery was developed many canneries came in there. My folks  worked up there every summer. One summer we was over to  Chuckman Bay  there was a Cannery there. I worked there for ﬁve cents an hour  put tins on top of these  cans of salmon  we used to have to puncture the top of the can   where the steam came in  then they solder it afterwards  well  this little piece of tin we put on there to keep the solder from  going into the ﬁsh meat  well that was my job  ﬁve cents an hour   put in ten hours at a time  I\u0027ve been working since I was that  small  but then I got work when I was fourteen I left from there. But then I had learned something about this ﬁshing camp  steam  and so on and so on  well that was the main thing. Of course   they went hop picking When the ﬁshermen wasn\u0027t working  he\u0027d  come up here to Puyallup. 1903  was the last time we come. But  that was the main thing  ﬁsheries  hopping and of course the  younger men  some worked in the logging camps and the  lumber mills  but my parents worked at the ﬁsheries. W: Last time that I was here  you mentioned that your uncle was  a medicine S: Oh yes  in the village where we lived  where: we   on the east side  amongst this allotment  there was a village  settlement in there with the 9:1l-l1sp.6 radius of about oh  a little over quarter of a mile. There were seven houses within that area. People lived there  out of the seven houses there were ﬁve medicine men. My Uncle Jim  was the youngest. That\u0027s where we commence to working was right above their place  How I happen to ﬁnd out  of course we used to go  somebody was sick in Canada someplace and they\u0027d ask my parents  they were good singers  to go up and keep time  beating on the sticks you know  and whatever it was  to keep time with these songs  so it basically gives the spirit more power to overcome the evil spirit. So one day mother and I  we went across the Swinomish Channel  we went to a farmer out there. And we come to a post and she said  \"What\u0027s that son?\" And I said  \"That\u0027s an ad from the store down there about what they’ were.selling.\"’ She said  “Take that and master it  we\u0027re slaves to this new country. Master that  and you\u0027ll be successful.\" And she said  \"Look at my cousin  Thomas Williams  he went to school  and ﬁnished this semester course up ‘here at Catholic Mission School in Tulalip. Mrs. Preston. She went on talking about who was successful. \"But you don\u0027t want to forget your background. Once in awhile  we go out and fast for a day or two  away from the habitat  up in the mountains where you can by and sit out on the Islands and bathe and pray not that you would become  but because nature will know you. Stranded some place  if the nature knows you  your not gonna get sick and die  you\u0027ll live So that. has been my livelihood  so my mother says  “look at your Uncle  his medicine is good as any.: I had two aunts  medicine was on both sides of the family which didn’t do us any good so the new culture is the thing. That was the very beginning. W: Can you describe for me what it was like when you started to school? Did you speak English when you started  the school on the reservation? S: No  I could say  \"Yeah\" and \"No\"  thats all I knew  (Laughs) The language was very much in Indian especially in that neighborhood  except what mother tells me about these people. But anyhow  these Indians  who understood the language  even if they didn\u0027t go to school  understood  enough to speak with other  the English language  theres very little  Chinook (Jargon) It wasn\u0027t there language at all. English in our Skagit  language  before I forget  a version of the Skagit language  or  dialect of the Skagit language was understood from Olympia clear to  South Bellingham  similar dialects were developed  the accent was  different. The Puyallups and the Nisquallies have similar accents. Up in  parts on the Skagit River Valley  there was a difference of how they  spoke much like say the difference of England and someone from  Georgia. But they understood each other. We went to school  that\u0027s all I  knew. But the teacher  she was very patient  she was  she knew what  she was doing. We had a teacher for a little while I think she was a  stenographer  a stenographer\u0027s wife. I forgot what her name was now   she used to draw on the board  we had blackboards all around the  school house. She\u0027d draw images. We had a number of pupils  instead  of going back to the Tulalip school  the mission school  they stayed and  went to school here. We had to walk to school  walk over to school and  the older boys and girls  would say  come on  we got to get there a  certain time. If we didn\u0027t  we\u0027d forget and start playing around. But anyhow we made  it. But the thing was  when we only went up to the fourth grade  thats as  far as we went. When I got to the fourth rade I stayed there  I don\u0027t know  what year was I got to the fourth grade but I stayed there  all these  young people left the reservation and went to some other place  they  got married and so on and left  sixteen and around there  ﬁfteen and  sixteen  and the boys were only seventeen and eighteen  and I stayed  there. But ﬁnally in 1904  this Mr. Potter. My ‘Aunt Lucy  oh there were  two pupils right from the fourth  there was Charles Billy  and Mrs.  (Name) Thomas McCloud  Lucy McCloud who went to Chemawa.

He could have taken the government to task for the niggardly manner in which it has treated this reservation while on other reservations  and notably in the state of Oregon  immense sums are spent every year to keep the buildings and grounds in the best of condition. _ But the federal government has promised to mend its ways by appropriating a sum of $20 000 or $30 000 from the general fund as a starter towards putting the fast decaying buildings into better shape. The sum named will not go far; but it is a starter and will probably be followed by other appropriations until. finally the Puyallup reservation school will occupy the place that it is justly entitled to hold. Establishment of the School The first Indian school in Washington. was established on Squaxson Island in 1857. This school was started under the provisions of a treaty made with the Indians of Western Washington in 1854  whereby the United States government: agreed to maintain schools for a period of twenty years on the reservations. In 1873 a new building was erected the Puyallup reservation. The building was of logs and it stood near the banks of the river. At that time the school! attendance numbered. but eleven pupils. In 1873 a new building was erected better if each one toiled for himself instead of for the general good of a\u0027l. The attendance at school gradually increased until 1875 when the roll showed forty-five young Indian pupils. But the twenty years for which the government had agreed to maintain the schools expired and in June  1875  the school was closed and all employee were discharged. School Again Opened Up. The. Indian schools were not destined vo remain closed for any great length of time. Influences were at work that goon caused the schools to be opened again.and on July 15  1875  Rev. M. G. Mann took charge of the reservation and school as superintendent  while Mrs. Mann acted as teacher  and from that date began the real advance of the Indians in educational matters. ‘The Indians who attended the schools previously were hardly able to read  and writing The school  under charge of Mr. Mann  opened with 20 day pupils. In 1879 the attendance had grown until there were sixty pupils boarding in the school and in 1882 a new addition 60x28  which is now a part of the dormitory  was added to the school. Mr. T. R. Wilson succeeded Mr. Mann as superintendent of the reservation vey  who writes on this subject in the Popular Science Monthly: “When it is said that Alaska has one fifth the area of the whole United States  one begins to have a more intelligent conception of its size  for in a general way the average \u003cAmerican readily forms a fairly accurate mental picture of the broad size relations of this country. “But so great is the extent of the United States and so difficult is it to judge accurately of the relations of geographical measurements  that even this ig not a satisfactory comparison. “For this reason our practical knowledge would not be much benefited were it stated that the area of Alaska is equal to that of three and one-quarter Californias  or ten Jowls  or one hundred and twenty-seven and one-half Connecticuts. “But if it were possible to take the whole territory of Alaska and its adjoining islands and place them upon the portion of North America occupied by the United States  it would be a simple thing to show exactly what the relations of these great possessions to our own country are. “Just this  in effect  has been done  as","community":"Native American","lat":"47.18538","long":"-122.2929"},"color":"rgb(0,158,254)","size":13.0},{"label":"\"An Exodus And An Opportunity\"","x":-69.47483825683594,"y":25.294002532958984,"id":"41","attributes":{"date":"1889-04-02","object location":"https://aweymo.github.io/CS.2/item.html?id\u003dmaplanguage041","creator":"The Sunday Oregonian","Modularity Class":"1","description":"Article directed to attracting Finnish immigrants towards the Pacific Northwest and Clatsop County in particular  and away from California.","industry":"Agriculture","location":"Clatsop County; Oregon","text":"AN OPPORTUNITY.

I Immigration continues as it has  there are only two possibilities: first  the development of a new race in America  a race neither American  nor Italian  nor Russian—but a composite race; or  second  the growth of separate racial groups within this country  and this means absolutely no assimilation. @ Do we want either of these? Our country has more laborers than it needs; we have agitation and unrest everywhere. Are we going to try some new remedy on this disease  or are we going to: its source and restrict immigration? .©several methods have been suggested. to restrict Immigration  the best of which are as follows: First  the exclusion of those unable to read and write This measure has three times passed both houses of Congress and been vetoed by the President. Second  the exclusion of unskilled laborers unaccompanied by wives or families. This would do away with the floating population and aid in assimilation. Third  increase in the head tax. Canada has done this in the case of the Chinese. It now amounts to 500 and is very effective. Fourth  the material  increase in the amount of money required to be in possession of the immigrant at the port of entry. Fifth  the Imitation of the number of each race arriving each year to a certain percentage of the average of that race arriving during a given period of years.
